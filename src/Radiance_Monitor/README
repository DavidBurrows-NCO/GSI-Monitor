README RadMon package 

The RadMon (radiance monitoring) package can be used to extract data from
radiance diagnostic files and visualize the results by plotting the data using
javascript or optionally GrADS.  The package also may optionally perform data 
validation and error checking.  The package is supported on wcoss2, hera, 
orion, cheyenne, jet, and s4 machines.

The package is organized in two main processes, data_extract and image_gen 
(image generation).  There is also an nwprod directory, which contains the lower 
level components of the data_extract portion.  The J-Jobs, scripts, and ush scripts
which used to be in the nwprod directory have been moved to the global_workflow
repository and must be run as part of the vrfy job in global-workflow.


To use the package:

1.  Run GSI-monitor/ush/build.sh.  This builds all necessary executables.

2.  The GSI-monitor sets default values for necessary storage, work, and log file 
locations in GSI-monitor/parm/Mon_config.  If you want to override the defaults
the important settings are: 

tankdir  -- the location for extracted data storage
ptmp     -- log file location
stmp     -- work space

Note that these locations are set for each machine.

3.  RadMon data extraction runs as part of the vrfy job in global-workflow.
    Make sure your expdir/*/config.vrfy file contains this line:

           export VRFYRAD="YES"
   
    The extracted data should be in your comrot/$PSLOT directory.  You can leave the 
    data there or move it to your $TANKDIR.  If you leave it in place you will have 
    to specify the location for the image generation and web site generation scripts 
    below.  If you would like to move the data to your $TANKDIR location run: 

        ./GSI-monitor/src/Radiance_Monitor/data_extract/ush/RadMon_CP_glb.sh

4.  Navigate to GSI-monitor/src/Radiance_Monitor/image_gen/html and run Install_html.sh.  
This will build and customize the files for a web site using the available 
satellite/instrument sources.  If you didn't move data to your $TANKDIR then use the
-t|--tank argument to specify the data location in comrot/$PSLOT instead of the default
$TANKDIR.

5.  Run the image generation.  Navigate to GSI-monitor/src/Radiance_Monitor/image_gen/ush
and run:

 ./RadMon_IG_glb.sh suffix -p|--pdate -r|--run -n|--ncyc -t|--tank

	suffix       $NET value or the name of your parallel.  
        -p|--pdate   Cycle time for which you wish to generate images.
                        It must be in YYYYMMDDHH format.
        -r|--run     $RUN value -- gdas (default) or gfs.
        -n|--ncyc    Number of cycles to be used in time-series plots.  If not
                        specified the default value of 120 cycles is used.
        -t|--tank    Location of the extracted data files.  This is likely to be your 
                        comrot/$PSLOT directory.  This is only needed if your extraction
                        was via global-workflow and NOT copied to $TANKDIR.

6.  Move the data and html files to the web server (emcrzdm).  If you're on wcoss2 and  
have set up password free access to web server for your account, RadMon_IG_glb.sh will 
queue the transfer script and move the files to the server.  Alternately the transfer 
script, RunTransfer.sh, can be run from the command line.

On all other machines you will have to manually move files from your $TANKDIR/imgn/$NET/$RUN/radmon
directory to the server.
